# SlotMachinePrototype
A slot machine game prototype built in Unity and C#. It features essential gameplay mechanics found in most enterprise slot machine games, and functions as a base starting point for any generic slot game.

I added an editable username feature, implementing a particle system, integrating Unity animations, and correcting UI issues. These enhancements will likely contribute to a more immersive and polished user experience in your project.

You can easily download the .apk file included above or you can download it from the release section. Once you have downloaded the game, you can unzip it and run ready to play!


# Download Instructions:
1) Make sure to Clone the Repo via Git or SSH; do NOT simply download the zip because I'm using Git LFS for the image and audio files.
2) Open the 'Gameplay' Unity Scene file in \SlotMachinePrototype\Assets\Resources\_Scenes
3) In the Unity Editor, change the Aspect Ratio to 5:4
4) In the Unity Editor, enable Audio (click on 'Mute Audio' to unmute)
5) In the Unity Editor, press Play and enjoy!
6) From here, you should have access to all of the project files and scripts.
